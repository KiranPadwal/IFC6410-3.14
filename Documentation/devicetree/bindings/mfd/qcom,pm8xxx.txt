Qualcomm PM8xxx PMIC multi-function devices

PROPERTIES

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be one of:
		    "qcom,pm8058"
		    "qcom,pm8921"

- #address-cells:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: must be 1

- #size-cells:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: must be 0

- interrupts:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: specifies the interrupt that indicates a subdevice
		    has generated an interrupt (summary interrupt). The
		    format of the specifier is defined by the binding document
		    describing the node's interrupt parent.

- #interrupt-cells:
	Usage: required
	Value type : <u32>
	Definition: must be 2. Specifies the number of cells needed to encode
		    an interrupt source. The 1st cell contains the interrupt
		    number. The 2nd cell is the trigger type and level flags
		    encoded as follows:

			1 = low-to-high edge triggered
			2 = high-to-low edge triggered
			4 = active high level-sensitive
			8 = active low level-sensitive

- interrupt-controller:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <empty>
	Definition: identifies this node as an interrupt controller

EXAMPLE

	pmicintc: pmic@0 {
		compatible = "qcom,pm8921";
		interrupts = <104 8>;
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;
		interrupt-controller;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		pwrkey {
			compatible = "qcom,pm8921-pwrkey";
			interrupt-parent = <&pmicintc>;
			interrupts = <50 1>, <51 1>;
		};
	};
